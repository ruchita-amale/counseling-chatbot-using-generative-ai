They are all referring  your action and telling that  you  this, this, this action, then only you are okay.  you are not able   this, this, this, then this action, then you are not okay. See,  action there  always conflict. What action? You don' understand? Because you can  many actions and there  always conflict. When there   option, there  always  conflict. Right? See,  you know, you are got only one mother and one father. You are  conflict  loving them, huh? But  you are got the option  choose which father, huh? Every day you will  jumping over  others, are only, huh? See, actions can  many, many kinds. And    not seek action  all. This  the specialty  this training, huh? This  the highest religious training that you will ever get anywhere. You can   anywhere, any place, this  the highest religious training. Because  are not teaching you what  , huh? That  why   the highest religious training.  are all caught   action  such  degree that  are unable  just stop and ,  can' , you know, experience the peace within ourselves. Because  are caught   action. See,  think only action will lead  something right, huh?  doing certain things  are going  get things right. But even though you have seen the futility  , still you cannot stop. You have seen the futility  trying  get this after that something else comes , after that something else comes .  there doesn' seem   really anything happening, huh? But  are just, you know, like  dogs, huh?  are simply running after action.  think  acting things are going   okay. Now  are, now, see our mind has never settled down  its peace, huh?   always going, staggering cluttered, huh? Just simply the bombardment  going  and  and , you may  sitting here, but your person who  not given you the rise  occupied your head, huh? Your husband who  not doing the right thing has occupied your head there. See,  are not able  keep our head empty.   always occupied  some  these people who are not okay, huh? Isn' ? The mind  always occupied  things not okay.  where  the place for God? See, God cannot enter  cluttered mind, you know?  fact, God  nothing but the experience  wholeness  nothing but the experience  God, huh?  what  are right now experiencing  insufficiency, huh? Like  things only. See, getting caught   this action, getting caught   this limitedness,  not okayness, huh? This you may call   being  Adharma, huh? This  being  the satan,  the satan, they call , huh? Who you are  fantastic, but you are now made yourself into some tiny little pocket and going  creating problems for yourself and everybody, huh? You have become the satan, not that satan  somewhere else, huh? You yourself have become the satan now.     very simple thing. See,  not focus  action. Now let  get into total non-action. Coming from everything  okay, what  you have  ? Nothing you have  , correct? Coming from everything  okay, huh? What  you have  ? Nothing you have  , correct?  now you' got yourself established  nothing  , not  something  . Meditation  nothing but being  the state  nothing  . You have been understanding this one, right? Law and doing  meditation. You understand why meditation   important.  fact, all religions started with meditation, but gradually ended   prescriptions for action. You understand? All religions went , started this way only. Everybody said,  want  take you  the kingdom within, huh?  doesn' matter which master, everybody said the same thing, right?  want  take you  the kingdom within, throw away this kingdom which  outside, huh? What you are going this way? But gradually what  turned into , again, huh? You must act like this, you must act like that, you must  like this, you know? What happened was, the maturity  religion was lost, and immature, how you would teach children they are teaching now. You have  teach  child, right? This  the way, this  what you , this  what you don' , huh? See, child does not know whether  eat mud  whether  eat food,  will eat both, huh? See, you have  say, see, you don' eat this, you eat this, you have  say. , initially  have  teach, huh? What they should , what they should not . But this has continued into the whole  adult life also has been only this prescription. Because people cannot see non-doing, everybody can see doing, huh? How  you judge somebody  what they don'    what they ? Why, why they  you judge them, huh?   very difficult  appreciate  saint, huh? Who  doing nothing?   very easy  see what somebody else  doing, but when  saint  sitting for meditation,  say '  waste  time. Isn' ? Huh? Why sit and  nothing? Huh? You could  fixing something  the world, you see? You could spend  very useful, you see? Huh? Why not  something? Huh? Why you have  sit  waste your time  meditation? And   all you did any kind  meditation,  was again doing something. See, for most   meditation means counting Rama  counting Krishna  reading Bible  reading some book, huh? This  what  call  meditation. Something must  done, you see, huh? Something must  done  that everybody can see something  being done.   you are reading Bhagavad Gita very loudly, huh?  lot  people will appreciate, see, reading Gita very loudly, huh? But   becomes  stitupra-knaa, then they say something  wrong with him. You see,   accomplishes the teaching  Gita, then they say something  wrong, gone wrong with him. See,  you talk about Jesus Christ, everybody will appreciate, huh? You become  Jesus Christ, everybody will stoth Ronan'  you. You understand? They will immediately tell you, hey, what happened? What  the where  your duty? Huh? You are now become involved with God. This  not the time  get involved with God. You see, , you got your child, you got your family, , whatever your duty they will say. Huh? When Jesus said, throw all your duty, come  , huh? Isn' ?  said, throw all, come.  you tell what Jesus said, huh, they will take you  task. But they will worship Jesus. Very foolishly, they will worship Jesus. This  what  happening everywhere.  right now, what  are turning our life  from action  non-doing.  are learning the process  reversing the flow  the mind, huh? From going out and getting caught  the world,  going into our stillness, huh?  doing nothing. Mind  tremendously activated  trying  act outside, huh? Now the mind will automatically settle down  you turn  inwards.  this inward journey, huh, that which shifts the direction  the flow from going out into the world into action into itself, huh? This  called religion. This  the religious experience, huh? See, you are full within. You know what you will start seeing? You will start seeing fullness outside also. When you are totally satisfied within yourself, huh? When your mind  very calm, then you will see calmness outside. When your mind  agitated, you will, you see agitation outside. Silence  the highest power  this universe, huh? That you will start  realize.  cannot tell you because this    experienced  you. Then only you will see, huh? Everywhere you , huh? This  the highest power. This  the source  all creativity. And   the source  all miracles also, hmm? Your life will become  miracle. And you will  able  create miracles also    deeper and deeper into this silence, you know?  call  this Atma-Shakti, huh? How  you tap this Atma-Shakti? The sinner power, how  you tap ? See, you cannot tap inner power  simply proclaiming, yes, you know,   going   . You may tell yourself 500 times   going   , huh? But you will not  . Because, see, there   power behind, huh?  will  . That power which, huh, which  the foundation for this  happen, that  called Atma-Shakti. That Atma-Shakti  only developed  going into silence.  will never come any other way, huh? You will realize this    along.  practice only you will realize, huh?  your actual experiential realization only you will know , huh?  amount   telling you will help right now, huh? Because  have realized this,  are telling you, huh? Because  have tried the path,  know, far some time.  don' say  are great, but  have realized that something fantastic here, huh? And  would like you  experience  also and take this   your own experimentation, huh?  your own realization. You know,  are also sages like you, huh?  are also going along and you also  along. But our great masters are given ,  want  give   you.  find that this  something very precious. And  giving ,  ourselves get something more, huh? Deeper and deeper every time. Because every time ,  say this,   listening  myself also, isn' ?   just  transmitter for  teacher, huh? When   saying this,   not saying .   just repeating ,  own teacher' words  that  myself get grounded  this.  doubt,  have gained  lot  mastery over this. And  would like you  gain this mastery also.  our sasana  something very superb here. And very easy, because what? You have   something. You see, you have been struggling and struggling and struggling  achieve. And here  tell you, look,  struggle  necessary, huh? Give  all struggle, huh? Here  the nectar. And truly   true.    much easier  operate this way, huh?    much, this whole sasana  nothing actually, huh?    wonder that  have not recognized . After you learn this sasana,  you  deeper and deeper into this, you will start wondering how come such  obvious thing  have missed.  you try   anything about action, then you will create more action only. That  why   difficult. You understand? Because one who  caught   action, huh, when  says, you know, just meditate, everybody will complain. And  said,  sit for meditation, but too many things come, you know, and even those things that  don' normally think come now. What  ? You know,   not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  person who  not  fan 03 ' just  little bit more
