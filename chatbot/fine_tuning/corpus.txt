 for  shank ara    was  going    the  road  and  then    took  some  some  intox ic ant  you  know  some  kind .  then  all  these  s isha  said  look    our  guru      taking  all  these  intox ic ants .  then  there  was  somebody  little  bit  ahead  somebody  was  pouring  iron  you  know  hot  iron  into  the  cast .    also  asked  him  give    some  iron  drink    was  able    drink  that  also .  then      something  else .  see  this  vive ka    you    some  unnecessary  sc ru ples  about  then  you  will  get  into  problems .  see  knowing  where  your  body  knowing  where  you  are    you  take    will  affect  you .  you  may  reach    stage  where  nothing  affects  you  that    bless  you  you  will  get  that  also .  but  until    get  that  point  till    will  enjoy  why  should    stop ?  correct  enjoyment  can  that    how  everybody    enjoying  whatever  they  want  thinking  that  the  world    going    give  them  enjoyment .  and  every  time    person  goes  after  the  world  for  enjoyment    gets  into  more  problems .  because    doing  something    doing  something  you  are  never  going      happy .  in j ement  whatever  that  comes  out    this  kind    phenomenon  anything  that  you  think  all  pleasures  that  come  from  outside  will  have    equal  pain      paid  back  later .      something  else  now .  you  see    you  are  thinking  that  the  world    doing  this      going    get  happy  and  you    you  will  have    pay    price  for    equal  price  for  this    your  action  and  reaction  are  equal    opposite .  pain  and  pleasure  come    equal    pleasures .  anything  that  you    after  pleasure  you  have    pay    pain .  there      matter  what  you  this    the  law .    you  went  after  pleasure  you  lost  money .    doubt  you  had  enjoyment  during  that  time  when  you  are  gambling .  but    you  think  that  gambling    going    give  you  enjoyment  and  you  have  gamb led  now  then  that      trap .  everybody      the  same  trap .  you  are  talking  about  you  know  cigarette  and  these  are  some  kind      obvious  you  know  things  that  people  can  say  you  know      not  spending  his  time  properly .  but  most    the  people  are  not  spending  that  time  properly    their  resources  properly .  because  all    them  are  focused    doing  something    get  something .  almost  every  person    the  world  now  looking  after  your  family  they  say      holy  task er  and  they  dedicate  themselves    looking  after  their  family .  you  mean    say  they  will  get  anything  out    huh ?  they  will  not  get  anything  out    sometimes    little  pleasure  sometimes    pain  huh ?  both  will  come    equal    stages .    anybody  who    trying      anything  huh      okay    this  world  will  never    happy .      impossible .  only    person  who    totally  fulfilled  within  himself  huh  now      does  something  without  expectation  huh  then      flowing  out    him .  happiness    flowing  out    him  into  the  world  you  know .  that      altogether  different  phenomenon .    doesn  bother  means    happiness  does  not  depend  upon  the  result    this  action .  that  huh  really      not  dependent  upon  okay ?    doesn  bother  means  whatever    the  result    the  action    this  huh    not  going    affect    life .    happiness    fully  stationed  within  myself  and  whatever  action      doing  the  result    that  action    not  going    bother  you  understand ?    long    you  are  going  after  something  for  enjoyment  huh  and  you  say      doing  this  because    gives    enjoyment    tell  you  the  same  b am  thing    just  going    give  you  lots    pain  huh ?      just  waiting    the  corner    tell  you  huh ?  you  are  going    have    lot    cancer  huh ?    lot    blood  pressure  all  these  problems .  just  waiting  huh ?  and    guarantee  you  you  will  get  huh ?  and  whether  you  like      not    will  come .  you  get  this  point ?  just  because  you  enjoy  you      whatever  you        man .  you  say  whatever  you    enjoyable    one  thing .  and        because    enjoy      wrong  process .  see  whatever      enjoy    something    very  you  know    advanced  state .  whatever      enjoy    enjoy  that    why      every  fool    doing  what    the  difference ?  every  person    doing    because    enjoys  that    why      doing  most  people  are  not  even    that  state  they  are  telling  that  after      this    will  get  some  pleasure  that    why      doing  this  this      third  level  huh ?  first  level      happy  whatever      doing      happy .  this    because  happiness    not  coming  from  outside      already  happy .    matter  what    does      happy .  his  total  ren unciation  has  come    him  huh ?  then  only    can    happy  doing  whatever    does .  second  person      doing  because    enjoys  doing  what      doing .        little  more  courageous  fellow  huh ?      doing  whatever    wants    whatever    enjoys  doing  but    will  have    pay    heavy  price  for    then  huh ?  then  there      third  person    says      doing  even  though      difficult .    don  like  what      doing  but  you  see    the  end      going    get  something  that    why      doing  this  man    prepared    pay  the  pain  before    gets  the  pleasure .  this  man  wants  the  pleasure  before  and      going    pay  for  the  pain  later .  this    the  only  two  difference  correct ?  but  both    them  are  caught    pain  and  pleasure .    the  one  who    not  caught    pain  and  pleasure    one  who    happy  doing  whatever      doing .  this    the  state .  you  understand ?  you  don    things  because  you  enjoy  doing  them .    you  don    things  because      not  enjoyable      them .  you  can  write  now    the  most    can      the  second  state .  the  first  the  second  and  third  stage  both  are  one  and  the  same .  one  correct .  one  wants  pleasure  before  pain  later .  another  one  pain  before  pleasure  later .  that    all .  and  the  one  who  wants  pain  pleasure  first  inevitably      very  dangerous  drive  huh ?  don  get  into  both    these  traps .  you  want  some  fun ?  you  are  aware  means  being    vive ka .    know  that  every  pleasure    caught    pain  waiting .  and  doing  things  because    pleasure    pain  both  are  bond ages .  just  med itate  huh ?  mar itate      the  settled  state  huh ?  and  get  under  and    whatever  you      perfectly  alright  afterwards .  but  you  must    happy  doing  whatever  not    particular  thing .  remember  this  huh ?

 good  evening .  what    you  know ?  what      apple  falls ?  any body  else  also  know  why    apple  falls ?    common  theory .  what ?    apple  falls  with  other ?    you  know  why    apple  falls  with  other ?    will    all  that .  you  know  huh ?  you  know  for  sure  why    apple  falls ?  well  that  what  the  theory  has  come  from .  but  you  think  you  know  right ?  yes .  now  here  are  the  good  engineers  and  scientists .  let    take    very  good  top  class  scientist  out  here .  who    the  peer  out  here ?    surreal  scientist    physics .    engineer ?  somebody ?    engineer ?  the  objective  force  between  any  two  entities  always  there .  this  gives  the  earth    much  bigger .  the  smaller  thing  comes  towards  what    the  apple ?  should  you      like  big  like  earth ?    bit      earth ?    don  know .  what    the  apple ?    why    apple  falls ?          reality ?  you  know  you  are  doing  well .  but  the  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit  tacit .  the  objective  force  the  force    attraction  between  two  bodies .    you  really  know  the  way  the  apple  falls ?  yes .  because  there  are  tracks    the  two  bodies .  they  attract  each  other .  and    the  apple  falls  appears    fall .  the  earth    going  towards  the  apple .  the  apple    going  towards  the  apple .    now  tell  why    two  bodies  attract  each  other ?  there      natural  force    attraction  between  two  bodies .      asking  the  way    what    attract  each  other .  opp osite  force ?  why    you  two  bodies  attract  each  other ?  that      reality .  that      whole  world .  amazing .  maybe        me onic  force .  why  two  forces ?  they  are  not    body  attract  each  other .    you  seem    know  when  you  come ?  come  and  clean  that .  you  see  what    the  advice ?  see  your  answer    repeat  what  you  said .    said  when  ask  why  two  forces ?  why  two  guys  attract  each  other ?    said  because      natural  force    acting .  what    you  know ?      asking  you  what    this  natural  force    acting ?  but  instead    telling  look  man    don  know  why  two  minds  attract  each  other .    know  that  two  minds  attract  each  other .  that    why    don  ask  any  further .    instead    telling    don  know  what    says .      natural  for  the  forces    attract  each  other .  all  that      telling    using  the  word  nature  that    don  know .  you  understand ?  but    camoufl ages          knows  something .  actually    doesn  but    makes    look    though    knows .  actually  does    know  why    apple  falls ?    you  understand ?    you  know  why    apple  falls ?  t elling    what      telling .    what    says  two  minds  attract  each  other  because  that  attract  each  other .  you  understand ?  what  more  you  are  defined    telling  all  these  natural ?  this  that  and  everything ?  well  here .  ad vers es  you  can  pl uck    apple  you  can  throw    out  for    down .  then  you  are  not  asking  the  force .  see      not  asking  any    them .  even  that  let      through .    doesn  matter .  but  when  you  use  the  word  natural  principle  law  what  are  you  stating ?  that  the  right  answer .  that    all .  that    all .  what  you  are  telling    why  they  attract  each  other .  because  they  attract  each  other .  that  all  you  are  telling .  what  else  are  you  telling ?  think  about  but  you  use  the  word .    prevent  you  are  ignorance  from  being  admitted .  actually  you  are  telling .    don  know .  but  instead    telling    don  know .  you  said  that  the  law .    can  this  scientist  just  give    the  principles .  what  happens ?  see  what      asking    doesn  matter .  see  you  don  know    you  know  why  two  birds  are  not  trying    each  other ?    course    don  know .  correct .  what      very  simple .  you  know  why    apple  falls ?  because    falls  itself .  you  see  actually  you  don  know  why  the  apple  falls .  but  you  say  because    falls .  now  you  can  say  for  example    knowing    little  bit    this  you  know        proportional    m 1 m 2      square  and  then      the  constant  factor  you  know  concerning  that  and  all  that  you  can  calculate  and  say  what  velocity    will  fall  depending    the  two  masses .  and  all  that  correct ?  but  why    apple  falls ?  you  haven  answered  the  question  actually .    you  are  going    say  because    falls .    the  apple  falls      sent    the  shuttle  you  know    the  space  and  put    one  place  what ?  tell  miles  above  the  ground .    might  not  fall  then .    might  stay  there .      asking  why    stays  there ?  you  say  because    stays  there  that  all ?    tell  you .  see  here  the  same  thing .  see  there      question .  answer    this .  you  are  simply  what  you  are  telling  that    what    you  don  know .  but    accept  that  the  way    that  what  the  answer  the  fact  that    should  keep    told  miles  above    won  fall .    falls  from  here .  that  what  explained  the  answer .  there    fall  because    something  which  reduces  and  ultimately  finishes  the  ends  the  distance    increased .  in versely  proportional  distance    distance  increases .  you  are  falling .  you  know  this .  you  know  this .  you  are  still  falling .  the  way    think  there      lot    crap .    know .  but      still  falling .  what  was    floating    the  sky ?    know .  they  are  still  falling .    are  still  falling .    are  still  falling .    are  still  falling .    are  still  falling .  see  granted  they  are  acting  everywhere .      still  falling .    true .  but  you  are  having  another  force    contract  what      telling    very  simple .  see  when  you      asking  the  question  why  you  will  come      place  where  you  would  say  you  know  use  all  these  fantastic  words  instead    telling    don  know .  you  can    one  two  three  steps  you  know  after  that  you  will  have    say    don  know .    don  know .  but    are  very  smart    you  know .    think  that    know  that    problem .    don  admit  that    don  know .  actually    don  know .  but    are  always  pretending    ourselves  that    know .  okay ?  m isha  vas ya op ani  say  very  simple .  you  know ?  the  one  who  says  the  one  who  says  the  one  who  knows  doesn  know .  huh ?  the  one  who  knows  that    doesn  know  really  knows .    are  not  smart      think    know  that  our  biggest  problem .  actually    cannot  admit    don  know .  what    the  big  problem ?  huh ?  what    the  big  problem ?      help    don  know .  huh ?      your  face    now  going      reduced  now .  your  value    going      reduced .  huh ?    you  understand ?    admitting    don  know .  you  feel  that  your  ego    hurt .  huh ?

 all  week  safe .  scientific ally  proven .    question  all  scientific  proven ness  because      also    scientist .  and  they  have  added  all  kinds    focus  focus  into    and  tell  this    the  truth  that    not  the  truth .    god    they  really  knew  what    was    wouldn  have  all  these  th al at omy  babies  you  know .  they  really  knew  when  they  put  and  all  these  fda  whatever    that    the  federal  department  for  drugs .  they  really  knew  and  they  approved  everything    perfectly  safe .  and  then  what  happened ?  why  didn  they  know ?  why  didn  they    scientific  fact  huh ?    question  every  scientific  fact  that    given  huh ?  you  must    willing    question  every  scientific  fact  because  all  those  researchers  were  done  under  different  conditions .  and  they  never  thought    this  condition  you  know .    somehow  happened  that  this  condition  they  never  looked    before .  just  like  bugs    the  software  you  know .      working  and  working  and  working    one  find    doesn  work .  you  know  you  find  that  the  program  wasn  working .  some  bugs  were  not  fixed .    worked    very  very  large  computer  programs .    know  huh ?  how  the  bug  shows  after  five  years  huh ?      working  perfectly  huh ?  what      telling  you  whatever  scientific  fact  they  say    very  very  questionable .  now  how    you  transcend ?  you  say  the  whole  the  whole  science    not  useless  huh ?    gives  you  certain  parameters  you  know  effect    certain  parameters  under  certain  conditions .  but    can  never  count  all  the  conditions .    very  limited  conditions  yes  these  are  okay .  given  these  conditions  yes    can  accept  certain  things .  but  normally  there  are    many  other  conditions  that  they  never  thought  like  simply  pop  you  know .  because  the  evolution    such  huh ?  that  these  conditions      changing .  and  new  conditions  will  come  out .  for  example  whatever  last    know  huh ?    will  change  abruptly  huh ?    the  point  you  know  what    call    singular ity      black  hole .    completely  changes .  the  last  absolutely  breakdown      appointment .  whatever    may  know  huh ?  these  singular ities  are  the  creative  processes    singular ity .  you  know    call    mutations .  usually    biological  species    always  going    one  direction  huh ?  you  can  usually  predict  what  the  next  species  will    like  you  know ?  hus band  and  wife  are  like  this  you  can  usually  predict  huh ?  that  the  child  will    somewhat  like  this .  but  sometimes    turns  out  that  they  will      totally  different  picture  huh ?    call      mutation .  and  that  mutation  will    such  that  you  know  the  whole  process  twice  all  done .    this  particular  one  will  survive    itself  then  the  other  one .  and    that  mutation    much  stronger  than  the  normal  then    you  wipe  out  the  rest  and  that  will  become  the  dominant  you  know  species .  this  process    mutation    unpredictable .  nobody  can    anything  about    just  seems    happen  you  know ?  because    the  change  conditions  there  seems        flick  that  happens    meet  that  challenge  and  suddenly  you  have  had    new  mutation  happen .  nothing    this  world    daily  predictable .  and  this  mutation    what      wonderful      evolutionary  process .        the  state    this  total  evolution    the  possibility      life giving .      stuck    the  known  huh ?  because  you  are  really  stuck    cause effect  relationship .  you  know  what    call    karma ?  really  cause effect  huh ?  and  along    you  are    the  cause effect  boil  you  are  stuck .    soon    you  release  yourself    the  cause effect  boil  and    open    these  new  possibilities  the  new  mutation  huh ?  you  are      tremendous  creative  power .  the  creative  power  within  each  one    potentially  present .  the  whole  process    how  you  bring  out  this  potential  power .    said  everybody    thought .  what    you  mean    everybody    thought ?  everybody  has  potentially  everything  huh ?  that  creative  potential    present    everyone .  now  how    you  bring    out ?  most    the  time  people  lose  their  creative  potential    they  grow .  isn  because  they  are  more  and  more  engaged    the  known .  they  want    exactly  the  way  that  they  thought        before  okay ?  they  want      secure    their  old  prescribed  concepts  ideas  grants .  and  this  limits  them .  and  they  are  going    continue      that  way  whereas  the  generations  are  passing  huh ?  new  things  are  happening  but  they  keep    their  own .  you  see  this    the  only  way    works .  and  then  you  have  got    lot    problems  between  parents  and  children  huh ?    call    the  generation  gap .  and  this  generation  gap  continues  continues .  un contin uous  because  the  natural  creative  process  huh ?  what  you  are  all  going  for      set    traditions  ideas  laws  morality  and  you  would  have  defined  right ?  and  you  say  this    the  right  way    live .  and  the  children  question    very  empty  you  know ?  they  say  why  daddy ?  why    should  only      that  way ?    will    some  other  way  and  see  what  happens .  that    for  the  generation  gap .  and  any  society  which  really  allows  for  this  kind    freedom  for  questioning  huh ?    really    very  open  society .    soon    you  say  this      tradition  manual  better    that  means  that  society    dead .  that    what  happened    india  for  long  centuries .  well    have  set  this    our  tradition  and  this      great  man .  that    questioning  whatsoever .  when  some      question    will      deb a ard  from  india  you  know ?  and    question  certain  basic  morality    basic  ann its    for  everything    will    considered    lot    guests .    now      going    tell  you    lot  more  about  enlightenment  huh ?  and    this  field    enlightenment        out cast  huh ?      the  biggest  out cast    the  country .  and  because    question  something  very  very  fundamental .  and  you  will  see  huh ?  like  you  know      very  hard  thing  when  somebody  thinks  that    knows  and    god  you  question  huh ?  they  cannot  answer .  but  say      right      right  you  can    telling  yourself      right  but  you  are  not  answering  the  question .  see  this    not    great    this ?    great      ask  questions  you  know ?  simply  ask  questions .  and  people  already  have  said      question .  because  they  didn  want      question .  you  would  ask  why    this  only  this  way ?  what    you  mean    this ?    want    know .    would  extend  the  question  one  more  why ?  and  the  person  would  collapse  you .  and  then  people  wouldn  admit  that  they  didn  know .  see  everybody  would  like    say  that    know  huh ?      living    life  man  look  what    have  built .    got    car    got    wife    got  this    got    breath  knowing    got  money  and  everything .  who  are  you    tell    don  know    live .    know  how    live .  look  this    the  way    live .  when  socrates  asked  the  question  these  things    became  very  uncomfortable  huh ?  they  had    give  him  poison .  all  the  men  asked  was      question ?  why ?  you  would  ask  the  question  why  you    what  you  are  doing ?  now  please  tell    more  about  what  you  are  telling .  and    people  regard    explain  more  they  have  found  that  they  were  talking  foolish .  but  they  wouldn  admit  they  are  foolish .  socrates  said    don  know  you  see ?  that      great  beauty    socrates  huh ?    said    don  know .    think    said    don  know    want    question .  but  everybody  wanted    show  that  they  know .  then  there      problem .  either  you  take  plate  huh ?  all  these  people  they  were  great  questions .
en light enment    being    the  state    not  knowing  not    the  state    knowing .  can  you  let  yourself    open ?    would  say    don  know .  and    willing    start  from  zero  again .  again  zero .  you  know  being    zero    enlightenment .  being  somebody    ignorance .  somebody  means  really  knowing  something .  you  know  when  you  attach  yourself    some  knowing ness  you  become  somebody .  like    engineer  huh ?  you  attach  yourself .  you  identify  yourself    some  knowing ness  which    become  engineer  huh ?  you  attach  yourself    some  science  which        with  the  body .  you  call        doctor  huh ?  any  knowing ness  attachment    any  knowing ness  will  give  you    identity .  and  they  are  all  caught      these  identities  you  know  our  memory      are  already  identified  with  for  example    structure    part .  for  example  like  capitalism  huh ?  communism .  all  these  are  boundaries  which    have  identified  with .  and    say      this      this .  isn    capitalist  huh  has  been    thoroughly  brain washed  into  believing    capitalism  huh ?    doesn  question  how    got  brain washed  into    first    all  you  know ?  you  see  there      motion    this  process  what    called    experience  and  belief  huh ?  rein force  each  other  always .  for  example    tell  you  believe  that    person lust  not  like  you  okay ?  you  know    you  start  with  that  belief  people  don  like  okay ?  then  believe  you  start  and  immediately  you  know  you  look    somebody  and  they  turn  their  head  away .  you  see  certainly  they  are  not  like  and  then  when  they  look    you  you  purposely    like  this .  and  that  tells    that  you  certainly  don  like  her  okay ?  and  that  person  says  the  better    live  her  alone  okay ?  and  now  you  prove    you  that  even  when  you  want      and  try  and  talk    her  she  says  better    live  her  alone  okay ?  and  this  reinforces  your  thing  that  people  don  care  huh ?  this  experience  and  belief  have  got    very  fantastic  process    reinforcing  each  other .  and    always  sir  you  know  live    certain  concepts  and  belief  systems .  and  that  becomes  very  difficult  for      get  the  experience  when  you  have  have      concepts .  see    can      very  easy    change    person  from  being    communist      capitalist .      not  very  very  difficult  because  still  there    some  concept    change  too  okay ?  can  you  live      concepts ?  can  you  allow  yourself    say    don  know ?  very  difficult  huh ?  see  because  you  are  hanging    the  air  with  nothing    protect  you  huh ?  everybody  gets  support .    you  say  communist  you  get    party .  and  you  say    capitalist  you  get    party .  but    you  say    don  know    don  know .    don  know .    don  know  people  have  got    lot    difficult  times  you  know ?

 you  call    am igo .  telling  what    mean    ego    very  simple .  you  identify  with  any  concept  idea  huh ?  anything  you  have  got    ego .  that  all .  for  example    may  have    hindu  ego  huh ?  you  may  have    muslim  ego      christian  ego  you  know ?  these  are  all  identities    some  particular  ways    living  huh ?  ways    expressing .  can    live    z er on ess ?  that  requires  courage  you  know ?  because      uncertain  huh ?  see  everybody  wants      certain  huh ?  all  this  tendency  towards  certainty  and  security  drives      identification  with  this  low  in ness .  everybody  wants    know  huh ?    want    know  why    future  will  you  see ?    want    secure    future .  you  have  got    insurance  plan .  right ?      why  would  you  take  insurance ?  because  you  want    know  that  you  will    secure  tomorrow .  everyone  wants    identify  with  this .  anything  okay ?

   you  live    the  paradigm    knowing ness  you  will  automatically  have  this  ego  and  the  protection    the  ego .  and  you  see  you  will  always  find  wonderful  reasons  why  what  you  are  doing  with  correct .  you  are  very  fantastic  thinking  about  the  intellect .  you  are  always  correct    see .  and  even    you  are  wrong  the  other  people  must  forgive  you  for  being  wrong  huh ?  because  you  did    not  knowing .  you  understand ?  you  see  whenever  you    something      because  you  did    not  knowingly .  but  whenever  somebody  else  does  they  did    purposely .  when  anybody  shouted    you  huh ?

 but  this    unpredictable  you  understand ?  this      total  spontaneous  process .      totally  unpredictable .  does  does    happen  gradually ?  you  understand  this ?  see  anything  that  happens  gradually    predictable .  but  this    predictable .      predictable ?  enlightenment  predictable ?  un per ic ulous .  correct ?  how  does    happen ?  sir .  you  understand ?  you  didn  understand .      never      never  happened  gradually .  very  interesting .  what  what  can  happen  where      going ?  because  anything  that  happens  gradually    predictable  within  the  cause      relationship .  you  understand ?        very  simple  factor .  and  you  are  going  beyond  the  cause      relationship  very  calm    the  bondage    karma .      beyond  the  bondage    karma          the  unpredictable    the  unknow ing  huh ?  you  cannot    from  knowing    the  unknow ing  gradually .  you  understand ?    long    you  still  think  that  you  know  something  what    you  are  still    the  knowing  only  huh ?      like  truth  you  see .    there  anything  like    99 . 9  truth ?  any body ?    there    99 . 9  truth ?  maybe  last  year  one  more  time .  correct .  and  you  will  ask  you  one  more  funny  question  too .  this    very  clear .  can  any  person      20  pregnant ?

and  lives    lifestyle  like  most      only  dream    has    official  position  and  commands  the  power  that  armies  could  never  possess .    stood  for    elections  and        leader  from  whom  leaders  would  but  debate  was  between  shank ara  and  mand ana  mish ra .  and  mand ana  mish ra ?  mand ana  mish ra  was    kashmir i  pand it va  and    was    k arm aya  k arm ami

shank ara  came  along  and  said    the  way  what  you  you  will  not  get  m ok sha .  you  can  get  pun ya  out    pun ya  you  can  get  sark a .  but  you  will  not  get  m ok sha .  this  debate  went    for    long  time .      the  most  important  debate  that  ever  undertook  from  this  planet .  thought    you  don  understand  but    believe  that  was  the  most  important  debate  that  went  then  shank ara  went  this  debate  and  then    became  disciple    shank ara .  that  was  the  tradition .  when  somebody    defeated    must  become    disciple .      became  s ures h war ach arya .  and    was  given  the  p ita    shank ara  not    disciple .    was  mand aram ish ras  but  was  given  the  p ita    shank ara .  and    wrote    important  tradition

through  here .    use  the  same  argument .  the  vibration    not  positive    doing  okay .  only  not  doing  leads    liberation .  the  first  statement    shank ara    the  dharma  s utra  version  says  that  means  liberation    through  at arma .  that    the  first    one  situation    which  the  entire  treat ise    through  the  same .  mind      mission      sad ?  are  you ?  that    following    the  rituals  getting      4 . 30 .  what  shipping  these  treat ise    these  particular  days ?  doing  tap ana  like  this .  and  then  doing  the  g ini  worship    the  morning    this  hour  and  afternoon    this  hour  and    you  follow      the  directions    ved as .  you  will  get    pots a .  you  are  very  strong .      the  entire  north .  that  means  you  are  having    very  powerful  strong  teacher .      just  like  sw ami  day a  n anda .  you  know  sw ami  day a  n anda  very  great  path  teacher .    took  over  whole    mark an  east .  came  from  bengal  for  about  7 15  hours .  ar isa    dear .  very  strong    punjab .        very  strong .  came  from  bengal    this .  you  can  imagine  such  great  colors .  they  have    discuss  for  21  days .  and  then  this  man  was  defeated .  but  most      are  not    smart .  you  can    defeated  faster  stand  learning .  shank ara  didn    have    much    time        doing  commentary    this  s utra  nish at th ya  n anda  p ane et th ya  and  you  know  then  you    through  bra hma  s utra  b asha  and  then  you    through  bh ag av ad  g ita  chapters  and  then  not  like  that .    you      some    the  traditional  schools  then  you  say  first  you  must    over  all  the  bra hma  s utra  b asha  then  you    through  the  up anish ads  then  you    through  bra hma  s utra  b asha  and  then  you      and  not  and  then  you  may  get  something .  shank ara  didn  have  that  much  time    convert  all  these  people        doing  you  know    just  went  and  gave    shot  like  this .  un con verted  you  went  somewhere  gave    shot  and  that  just  one    two  disc ourses    converted  the  entire  population .    that  time  there  were    loud  speakers .    tape  record ers .  correct .  from  doing    non doing    converted .  the  entire  country  that  was  shank ara  d ik uj ya .  you  know  that  was  his  d ij ya .  but  shank ara  d ik uj ya  did  not    very  deep .    did  not  you  did    pretty  deep  but    did  not    very  deep .  the  knowledge  was  again  forgotten .  very  soon    was  forgotten .  you  didn  get  into  the  general  population  the  bra hma  pradesh  dinner  get    deeply  into  probably    did  but    got  lost  again .    after  shank ara  these  first  time  that  this  knowledge    being  regained .  very  few  people  there .  very  few .  that  supposed      900 .  but  the  historical  thing      was  very  you  know  about  1500 000  people .  but  another  historical  document  says    was  900  years .  yes .  one  who  made  everything  integrated      film    something  after  but  this .  but  because  shank ara  ch arya  after  him    established  the  pit as .  and  those  people  also  call  shank ara  ch arya .    what  has  happened    there      lot    confusion      who    the  real  shank ara  and  from  whom    came .  can  yes      not    shank ara .    know  that  the  title    correct .  but  you  see  shank ara  pit as  they  are  authorized    have  shank ara  ch arya .        one    the  sub s ank ara  ch arya .      not  even  the  shank ara  ch arya    sh ring er ip anta .  but    belongs    the  sh ring eri  mark .  one    the  shank ara  ch arya  one    the  med ley  you  know  there      k ud li  matt a .  there      one  matt a    place  called  sh uk anga .    there  are  many  many  small  mat as    which  they  are  there .  they  have  appointed  there  people    their  heads .  they  are  also  called  shank ara  ch arya .  for  example  sw ami  r ama    says    know  that  shank ara  ch arya .    was  probably    small  p ita .  you  know    was  given .  but    was  not  the  shank ara  ch arya    did  not    but  people  say    was  given  shank ara  ch arya .  anyway    doesn  matter .  that      shank ara .  that  was    many  years  back .  but  what  was  the  important  thing  that  shank ara  did  was    draw  the  knowledge    n and u .  and  what  happened  slowly  after    went  into  this  process  while    has  been  skewed  upon .  then  what  they  said        not  out    doing  then  they  started  taking      k arm ay oga .  you  see        not  out    doing  that  you  are  going    get  then    must    out    understanding .  then  they  said  k arm ay oga  cannot  lead    m ocks ha .    must  always  g han ay oga  only  leads    m ocks ha .  and    there  are    many  missions  but  they      telling    are  the  g han ay oga    are  better  than  the  k arm ay oga .    are    the  paper    are    the  b aza arat  g ita    will  tell  you  that  g han ay oga    better  than  k arm ay oga .      this  skewed  up ness  instead    non doing  what  they  have  done    they  converted    into  understanding .  understanding    not  non doing .  nobody    transformed    their  knowledge .  you  can    and  listen  1000  times  till  you  will  not  get  anything .  because  the  real  thing  comes  only    non doing .  one  experience    non doing    worth  500 000  lana ch us based  spiritual  man .  but    lecture    cannot  give  you  lecture .    the

and  when    will  happen  after  years    will  not  happen .  right  now  see ?  right  now  just  being  with  whatever  there  every  time  you  are    meditation  you  are    silence .  you  are  burning  away  all  your  karma .  that  means  whatever    your  past  histories  they  are  all  getting  burnt  because  you  are  not  dependent  upon  the  past  histories .  you  create    new  history  huh    med itating .    you  went  along  with  without  meditation  and  freedom  you  would  simply    adding  more  fire    whatever  that  was  happening .  then  you  would    bound    karma .  once  you  start  releasing  yourself  now  you  start  establishing    new  way .  and  you  are  alive  because  you  are  living    this  state  ast aff ial    doesn  matter  whether      going      good    bad  also  correct  you  understand ?    person    m ok sa    not  trying      good .  only    person    bondage    trying      good  because      naturally  bad .      trying      good .  m ok sa    already  good  tries      good  you  see .  those  who  are  trying      good  are  all  fools .  but  better      good  than  trying      bad .  but  your  love  for  you  can    even  better .  any body  who    trying      good      fool .  but        better  fool  than    person  who    trying      bad .    person  who      m ok sa      already  good  and    doesn  even  bother  whether  the  things  that    does    going    turn  out  good    bad .      not  concerned  about  the  good    bad .  good  and  bad    only  for  people  who  had      told  what    for    person  who  doesn  who    not  within  that  context    being  told  what    because      doing  purely  out    his  own  pure  wisdom  pure  freedom  from  within .  and  that    people  says  you  know      doing  whatever    want          m ok sa  not  true .  just  because  you  are  doing  whatever  you  want    you  will  not      m ok sa .  because  whatever  you  want    maybe      reaction    something  that  you    not  have .  you  understand ?  you  are  doing  whatever  you  want    from  the  sense    that      not  have    want    have  then    will    happy  okay ?  whenever  you  are  doing  something  because  you  want    have  something  you  want      happy  after  getting  then  you  are  not  really    freedom .  you  are  being  driven    this  thing    really  get      and  you  are  not  okay .  you  understand ?  you  are  not    freedom .  freedom      internal  space .  there    also    lot    people    think  that  how  they  are .  right .  most    the  people  are  stuck .  and  they  think  they  are  doing  whatever  they  want    but  they  are  not  really  doing  what  they  want    they  know  that  why  they  point  out  you  are  not  doing  just  because  you  want    because  you  are  influenced    this  cause  effect  that  you  are  doing  you  think  you  are  neither  god    god  you  will  also  get    car  then  you  will    happy .  then  that      full  sparse .      takes  you  except    you  stop  make    happy .  correct .  correct .    you  are  doing  anything      happy  and  think      doing  whatever    want    not  find  out  whether  you  are  really  why  you  are  doing  whatever  you  are  doing .  the  leader    necessarily  coming  from  total  freedom  and  giving  and    follower    necessarily  coming  even      thinks      doing  whatever    want    not    people    the  world  they  don  care  for  others .  they  will    against  the  law  they    whatever  they  want    okay

but  most    the  people  they  think  that    freedom .  why  you  want  more  money ?      can    free .  why  you  want  more  power ?      can    free .  you  mean    say  that      going    give  you    full  freedom ?  never .  but    spite    you  will    for  money  anyway .  you  see  you  may  talk    this  next  day .  process  yourself .  okay .  first  you  get  and  then  every  meditation  will  clear  more  and  more  and  more  and  more .  when  you  are  always    the  med itative  state  then  you  are  released .    you  are  having  many  enlightenment  every  day .  but  the  enlightenment  will      growing .  but  this  enlightenment      less  than  the  bigger  enlightenment .  this    perfectly    enlightenment .  only  under  very  safe  conditions  you  are  able    just  now  under  more  difficult  conditions    becomes .  more  difficult    just  light    just    patient .  and  people  who  are    m ox as  city  they  are  necessary  build    far    god .  can  you  please  take  and  america  can  also  build    person  who    out  there .    don  think  because  the  basics  are  not  proper .  when  the  basics  are  from  m ox as  like  m ox as    present .  and  that  m ox as  conscious      present .  then  the  solid  foundation    there .  and  necessarily  people  are  happier .  because  they  are  happy  they  are  building    beautiful  world .  these  are  the  different  higher  levels      far  god  gets  built .

 are  you  bound    are  you  feeling ?  you  ask    philosopher  then  you  will  know .      what  extent  the  fellow    not    they  are  not    they  are  not .      this  time  that    have  found  that  that  99 . 9  percent    all  our  philosophers  are  all  better .  because  they  only  subscribe    the  karma  theory .  they  don  know  anything  about  freedom .    where  does  the  freedom  exist ?  and  how    the  freedom  generated  there ?  what    sad h ana ?  see  these  are  fantastic  questions .  what    sad h ana ?    must  agree  for  one  thing  that  every  cause  has    effect  and  every  effect  has    cause .  this  also    cannot  deny .  then    everything    cause  effect  then    will      mechan istic  mon ot ony    well  and      not    all  interesting .  because  everything  can    predicted .  the  whole  essence    life        the  state    creativity  where  you  can  experience  that  you  have  got    say  mean  what    going    happen ?  and  people  are  prepared    play  very  heavily  for  experiencing  this  freedom .  and  what    sad h ana ?  sad h ana    the  retrieval    karma  that    what    sad h ana .  sad h ana    not  trying    achieve  some  problem    repeating  the  name    ram ay ana  every  day  for  one  thousand  and  eight  times  and  then  you  will  receive  much  more .  you  will  not  get  anything    doing .  all  this    nonsense .  whatever  po o ja  you  you  are  again  bound .  whatever  you      only  more  binding  more  karma  cause  effect .  the  only  way    release  from  karma      get  into  a kh arm ah .  that    why    says  why    works ?  because  the  essence  for    about  non doing      not  about  doing .  what    sad h ana ?  more  doing ?  doing  a ks ana    sad h ana .  only  non  doing    sad h ana .  when  you  experience  you  are  not  doing  anything  that    you  are    the  state    sad h ana .      somebody  and    you  continue    pursue  your  somebody    then  you  will  build    history  and  there      rather  particular  extrap olation .    long    you  are  living  yourself  within  the  boundary    that  somebody    things  are  predictable .  because  that  other  somebody  has  gone  this  way  you  somebody  will  also    this  way .  product ibility  comes  only    somebody .  and  most  people  they    not  know  how    get  out    that  somebody    they  are  simply  going    reinforcing  their  somebody    and  their  life  becomes  more  and  more  predictable .  where    that  possibility  for  freedom ?      only      nobody  you  have  the  freedom .    long    you  have  somebody  you  are  stuck .  what    this  sad h ana ?      being  releasing  the  doing  and  entering  into  nobody    where  you  experience  the  freedom .  actually  you  experience  the  freedom  from  all  boundaries .  otherwise  you  are  bound    your  previous  conditioning .  now    this  process    going  into  nobody    you  experience    new  possibility  which  never  was  there  before .  and  that    beautiful .  and  that    why  suddenly  people  when  they  come    they  are  60  years  old  but  suddenly  they  feel  very  very  angry .      they  were  15    16  years .  because  that  sense    freedom  that  they  had  again  becomes  experienced .  say  again    feel    can  restart    life .  and  when    life ?    total  movie  called  given  movie .  when  you  are  doing  everything  because  you  want    and  nothing    done  because  you  have    and  when  you  are  doing  everything  that  you  want    you  don  experience  any  effort    your  life .  when  you  are  experiencing  total  effort lessness    your  life  then  you  have  attained  given  movie .  otherwise  you  are  experiencing  going  towards  that  but  you  are  not  experiencing    yet .  that  point  where  you  really  kick  this  binding  where  you  are  purely  doing  because  you  want    not  because  you  have    that  state    given  movie .  and  once  you  have  tested  once  you  have  gotten  very  difficult    lose    also .  there      very  special  jump .  and  that  jump  will  happen  when  you  just  let    everything .  and    the  realization  that      responsible  for  everything    get  the  freedom      something  about  what ?  see  whether  you  like      not    long    you  are  within  somebody    karma    holding      that  somebody .  true  somebody    because  you  are    somebody        bound    happen .  somebody      which  you  have  acquired .  and  everything  within  that  somebody        predictable .  what    the  condition ?  getting  correct  correct .  correct .  what    the  cause ?  because  there  are    many  interactions .  what  can    say  you  want ?  yeah      attributable    god .  see  what    grace ?  grace .  grace    the  freedom  that  you  experience .  and    soon    you  will  total  surrender fulness  that  means    the  state    non doing  then  grace  desc ends .    soon  you  see    soon    the  unb ounded ness  begins    take  over  you  are    more  within  the  boundaries .  yes  you  are    more  bound .    nobody    you  are  not  bound    karma .  the  un gross ed  relief  for  the  rest    the  time  also  and  being    better  than  and  the  effect    meditation      bring  you    that  state   but un us  all  the  time .  med itates      the  end  regularly  and  abandon  yourself  like    child .  you  will  start  experiencing .  nothing      not  quick .      nothing .  and  then  you  will    very  happy  for    reason .  because  all  unh appiness    because  you  are  unable    protect  your  know some body ness .  when  you  are  nobody  you  are  happy  when  you  are    reason .  and  that    the  only  real  happiness .  otherwise      somebody  you  are  happy  when  you  are  protected .  when  you  feel  that  your  somebody ness    protected .    soon    your  somebody ness    not  protected  you  feel    lot    unh appiness .  happiness  work ah  and  n ara q ah  exists  only  for  somebody .  one  who  has  transc ended  work ah  and  n ara q ah          state  called  m ok cha .  for  him  there      sv arg a    n ara q ah .    has  transc ended  that  into  the  state    bliss .  suk ha  and  dh ik ha    only  for  the  ego .  the  ego  feels  suk ha  when      feels  protected .    feels  dh ik ha  when    feels  kicked .  when  you  are  living  beyond  the  ego  you  are      state    par ab rah mast i dh ik ha  where  you  are  bliss .  and  sat ya    an ad han bh aya  very  powerful  weapon .  this  kicks  you g ave  you  see .  exactly .  not  lot    fully .  you  simply  take  that    will  live    sat ya  absolutely  from  this  moment .  all  your  k arm as  are  kicked    one  stroke .    requires  courage .  see    a gan a  does  not  require  timing    doesn  require  effort .  only    requires  courage    kick .    kick  all  that  protective  mechanism  which  you  are  used  and  not  out    you  kick  you  will  get  more  courage .    you  get  more  courage  you  can  kick  more .  and    you  kick  more  you  get  more  courage .  the  other  way  around  the  more  you  are  afraid  the  more  you  hold  the  more  you  hold  the  more  you  will  get  afraid .  the  more  you  get  afraid  the  more  you  hold  and  this  cycle  will  tend    become  make  you  less  and  less  competent .  and  that    why  most    the  people  you  know  become  incompetent  there .  the  more  you  say        mechanical  engineer        mechanical  engineer    become  incompetent    learn  electrical  engineering  and  the  more  you  say  this    only    field  this    only    field  when  you  become  less  and  less  competent    handle  any  other  field  then  you  become  incompetent    that  field  also  because  you  cannot  learn  anything  more .    your  ego  will  you  know  will  put  you  down    become  more  and  more  fearful  more  and  more  anxious  you  reduce  your  level    influence  level    territory  you  reduce  because  you  are  afraid .  and  now      child  gets  afraid  what    will    will  not  run    the  house  right ?

freedom .  everybody  wants      free .  but  how ?    this  talk  sri  rav iji  one    the  oldest  disciples    guru ji  sri  r ishi  pr ab hak ar  tells    what  true  freedom  freedom .  freedom .    look  into  what    freedom .  freedom  means  freedom  means      whatever  you  like .  freedom  means    think  whatever  you  like .  freedom  means    whatever  you  want    you  want      like  anything  you  want    dance  now    you  can  dance  you  are  free .  you  want    say  something    somebody  you  can    and  say  something    somebody  you  are  free .  you  want    sit      not  disturbed    anybody  and  you  can    that  way  you  are  free .  sat ant ara .  whatever  you  like        freedom .  this    what  the  normal  understanding    freedom .  but      the  other  way  around .  that    freedom    the  opposite    this .  what    what    like  whatever  you  like  whatever  everyone  does    you .  like  whatever    happening  right  now .  like  whatever    happening  both  internally  and  externally .  whenever  you    anything    you  want  you  are  free  from    wanting    not  wanting      whose  hands ?  why ?  hmm ?  one  thing    not  one  thing      your  own  hands .  you  may  want  you  may  not  want  but  you  are  not    free    say    want        don  want    there .  you  are  offered  bound    sat an  things  which  are  already  conditioned  before    hand .  like    want    only    these  conditions .  hmm ?    want  you  only  when      free .  when    have  nothing  else    want  you .  you  know    sat an  conditions    want  you .    sat an  conditions    want  you  and  whatever  you    like  but    you  come    this  hour  please  don  disturb  you  know  that  means  you  are  one  turned  not  wanting  likes  and  disl ikes  are  already  conditioned .  already  conditioned .  already  conditioned  because    are  being  living    one  set    life  thinking  this      safe  free  zone .  people  are  very  free    home .  they  think    least  you  know    some  extent .  you  know      free .  you  know  you  vote  your  home  you  remove  your  t ans h ars  and  wear  one  dress y  and  then    shirt  v any an  something  like  that  and  you  hear .      free  huh ?  hmm ?  and  somebody  comes  you  say  somebody  comes  sh ush  sh ush  sh ush  sh ush .  you  know  you  feel  your  freedom    now  restricted .  you  know ?  you  are  freedom .    what  degree  you  are  free  depends      what  degree  you  have  got  the  condition  set .  normally  you  know ?  that  condition ?  more  free .    condition ?  totally  free .  you  know  when  you  have    conditions  whatsoever  you  are  free .  how  you  can  have    conditions    your  surface  when  you  have    conditions    anybody .  and  everybody  everybody .  then  you  are  free  because  freedom      two way  traffic .  freedom    that ?  two way  traffic .  that  means  unless  you  all  know  everyone      free  you  cannot    free .      sense  what  are ?  unless  you  all  know  that  allowed    hit  you  you  cannot  hit  that  first .  hmm ?  freedom      two way  traffic .  unless    all  know  you      free  the  way  you  want    why  you  cannot  expect  myself      free  with  you ?  otherwise      conditioned    you .  when    condition  you      already  conditioned    you .  when    say    feel  very  happy    you  are    d ross    this  way .    you  come    the  other  way      restricted .  you  know ?    you  come      and  then  take    bath  and  all  that  and  then  you  come    then    will  hug  you .  you  know ?  you  know ?      restrict  you  with  that  condition      not  free      free .  and  even  though  you  are  not  there    already  care    this  condition  even  without  you .  hmm ?  even  without  you      conditioned .  for  example    tell    wife  you  should  not    with  any  guy .  you  should  not  talk    any  man .  you  should  always  maintain  this  distance .  okay  you  must  always  behave  this  way .    have  all  these  conditions  that    least      don  tell    keep        mind .  whether    tell    not      keep        mind      not  free .  right .  where ver  she    will    watching .    will    worried  about  what  she    doing  why  she    talking    this  person .  what    their  problem ?  even    she    not  there    carry  because        going  with  another  person    will  carry    she  does  this  thing  with  another  person .  that    how  the  freedom    restricted .  any  conditions  you  put    anyone    whether  that  person    alive    not  you  are  not  free .  even    god  you  put  conditions  you  are  not  free .  you  know    god    born  freely .  how  can      born  free ?  when  you  have    conditions  for  forever  your  god  will    free .  just  like  your  god  you  are  free .    your  god    like  this  who  will    this    this  and    this    this ?  you  know  like    protects  the  people  who  will    good  and    will  punish  the  people  who  will    bad  then  you  are  also  conditioned      only  such  things  and  the  condition  not      those  things .    you  are  not  free      anything .  but    you  are  just  thinking  about  the  god  you  are  not  free .  any where  whoever  you  see      the  same  thing .  whether    god      anybody    anything    same .  the  whole  world      reflection    you .  actually    know  ch ai  s ari .  but  the  same  type    freedom    not    problem .  correct  but  the  same .  freedom  needs    make  ch ai    whatever  you  want .  freedom  needs  freedom    make  ch ai  s ari .  yeah .  condition    then  how    come  out    yeah    will  come    that .    all  conditions  you  said    anyone  including  you      you  only .  with  those  conditions  only  you  are      restricted  aff ew er  freedom .  you  can  only  choose  that  which    within  your  conditions .    you  are  left    some place  where  your  conditions  won  work  you  feel  you  are  restricted .    you      some place  and  your  conditions  are  not  there  like  you  say  you  must  eat  with  your  right  hand  only .  like  this  you  have  got    condition .  there  you  people  simply  hug .  like  they    you  are  putting  both  hands  and  legs  and  everything  and  they  eat .  then  you  feel  that  your  freedom    taken  away .    may    with    civilization  man  going      unc ivil ized  place    unc ivil ized  man  coming      civilized  place .  you  have  seen  god  must    crazy .  you  know  say  work    them  feel  the  same  restriction    freedom .    far    you  don  understand  that  this    how    the  only  way    come  out    the  freedom      see  that  this    how    right ?  this    how    this  sense    letting    comes  when  you  start  looking    the  things  that  this    all  that      all  there      all  there  when  you  come  into  that  state    nothing      done  all  fine .  perfectly  okay .  then  you  have  freedom    have    choice .  and  that  choice      live    the  moment .  the  way    there  are  two  ways    living .    was  telling  you  already  about  one    the  things  like  one    our  teachers  were  telling .  but  whatever    want    get  whatever    get      want  this      statement .  that    what    the  statement .  what  did    get ?    want    said  whatever    want    get  fine .  whatever    get    want  until  you  get    you  have  tension .  whatever  getting    want    every  moment  enjoying  the  life .  you  are    meteor istic  s anny asi .    s anny asi  meteor ologist .  you    this .  that  all .  see  this  person  has    choice    the  extent    getting  what    wants .    his  choice  depends    the  thing  that    gets .      choice  depends    what ?  nothing .    depends    nothing .  correct .    depends    nothing .  freedom  standing    its  own    freedom .  freedom  standing    something  else    not  freedom .  you  know      say  very  free  because    you  because    you  released    this  one  day .  you  are  bound    you  are  already  bound .  like  somebody  went    buddha  and  told  her    buddha  you  blessed  because    your  grace  able    med itate .  you  know  what    happening  now ?  whenever    close    eyes  you  only  come      mind .  and  buddha  said  take    sword  cut  off    head .  you  know  because  you  think  that  because    you  are  doing  this  you  are  still  bound .  but  having    reverence  and  getting  stuck  are  different .  having    reverence  bh ak ti    different  from  getting  stuck .  hmm ?  actually  reverence  come  out    letting  not    getting  stuck .  they  are  totally  opposite  actually .  you  know  when  you  can  accept  that  person  whom  ever  you  have  reverence  means  when  you  can  totally  accept  however  whatever  whatever  whatever  whatever  all  the  conditions  with  that  person    perfect  you  okay ?  you  know ?  and  however    becomes  later    okay .  whatever    does    you    anybody    okay .  you  know  whatever    won      perfectly  okay .  everything  with  respect    that  person    totally  okay .  then      the  bh ak ti .  you  know ?  what  they  say    ar v ab hak ti  s utra .  nar va    asking  the  question  what    bh ak ti ?  nar va  says  bh ak ti .  bh ak ti    the  ultimate    love .  dev otion    the  ultimate    love .  that      culmination    love    eat    bh ak ti .  love  culmin ates  into  bh ak ti .    says  the  next  question    asked  about  the  student  what    love ?  nar va  says      something  you  cannot  explain .  okay  basically  with  bh ak ti      also  the  nar va  ultimate    end .  because  letting  can      said  anyway  about  doing  nothing .  like    anybody  else  what    doing  nothing ?  just  doing  nothing .  any  effort    teach  doing  nothing    not  doing  nothing .  because    another  person  says  that  you  can  give    description    the  thing  you  can  add  one  two    three  things  one    four  things  that  why    want    ask .  they  say  the  results  are  bh ak ti .  they  never  say  about  what    bh ak ti .    cannot    said .  even  ar j una  asks  krishna .  you  know ?  what      fit ap ra j na ?  who      fit ap ra j na ?    will  just  find    bh ag av ad  g ita  let    know .  you  will  say  what    the  result    being  fit ap ra j na ?  you  know    will  never  say  what    fit ap ra j na ?      fit ap ra j na ?  but      what    and  whatever      here    will  ask  fit ap ra j na    cannot  tell  you  anything  more .  this      great  secret .  the  final  statement      great  secret .  you  have    find    out    yourself .    letting    only  you  will  know  what    and  not      explaining    you  things .    you  making    choice    cho ic eless ness .  you  know    making    choice    cho ic eless ness  that  whatever  happens    perfectly  fine .  you  know ?  whatever  happens    perfectly  fine .  you  know ?    that  only  you  will  learn  what    the  rating .  how    make    choice    cho ic eless ness    the  next  question .  again .    will    like  that .  you  really  easy    realize  you  know  you  can  put  different  words  there .  but    will  not  make  any  sense  until  you  say    with    does  not  matter .  you  know ?  whatever    that    what  the  freedom  freedom    not  simply  having  certain  conditions  and  happy  because    those  conditions  are  maintained .  you  know ?    lot    people  will  feel  they  are  safe .  everyone  feels  safe .  when  those  conditions  are  set  and  they  are    those  conditions  people  feel  safe  when  they  don  leave  their  home .  people  feel  safe  when  they  don  leave  their  town .  people  feel  safe  until  they  are  safe    that  job .  they  feel  safe  until  the  wife  will  not  say    man .  you  know ?  people  feel  safe  until  they  are  buying    balance  and  they  feel  safe    much    the  neighbors  won  trouble .  they  feel  like  there  were  some  safety  zones .  safety  zones .  and  they  are  not  safe    those  zones  again .    you  making    particular  choice  you  have  made  yourself  unsafe .  when  you  say      safe    home  already  have  created  uns afety  all  around .  the  whole  thing  around  has  become  very  unsafe  for  you .        more  secure  fault .  just  because  you  made      secure  here .  just  because  you  made    choice    ignorance  the  choice    ignorance  creates  more      trouble  around .  any  choice    ignorant  man  makes  leads      problem .  all  the  ignorant  people  ask  what  choice  should    make  guru  mahar aj ?    the  guru  says  who  shall    marry ?  tell  this  lady    beautiful .    love  her .  but    parents  say  marry  this  girl  because  she    very  good      parents .  who  shall    marry ?  should    marry  the  person  whom    love ?

   they  feel  that  you  are  able      whatever  work  you  are  able    then    person  will  come    help  you .    they  think  that  they  are    lot    work  and  guru ji  wants    lot    help  then  lot    people  will  come    help  you    you  must  understand  one  thing .  you  see  you  must  give  them    lot    work .  you  must  give  them    lot    work  then  you  will  have    lot    lot    disciples  going  along  with  you .  and  then  the  next  day    took    upon  himself .  and  then    started  ordering  them  around  that  this  must    done  that  must    done  this  must    done .  all  the  25  also  left  right ?  once  you  realize  then    new  possibility  you  know  you  become  you  become  the  source    that  new  possibility  around  which    greater  civilization  will  begin    bl ossom .      doesn  mean  you  have    throw  away  whatever  you  have .  but  don  try      sane  that  all .  don  try    make  yourself  better  than  others .  don  try    make  yourself  earlier  than  others .  don  try    make  yourself  important .  you  know  all  these  things  are  about  sanity  proving  your  sanity  proving  that  you  are  great  and  whatever  you      fantastic  and  all  that  nonsense .  then  you  drop  suddenly  whatever  you    really  becomes  very  important  you  know ?    don  know  how  but      suddenly    inspiration  that  comes .  whatever  you  suddenly    new  meaning .  all    you  only  one  thing  you  have      aware  now  whatever  you      useless .  but  don  stop  doing      knowing  that      perfectly  useless .  okay  whatever  you  are  doing    perfectly  okay    has    meaning .  what    are  telling  you  what  you      un important .  first  you  get  this .  see    long    you  are  feeling  that  what        important  what  gets  accomplished    important .    long    you  are    that  paradigm    what    accomplish    important  then  commitment      important  thing .  you  cannot  get  out    see  this  training      realize  that  nothing    important .  you  understand ?    the  paradigm    nothing    important  and  when  you  realize  that  nothing    important  really .    what ?  correct .  and  really  the  world    that  way .    what ?  you  are  accomplished .    what ?  after  what ?    everybody    trying    get  satisfaction  after  getting  somet h ings  done .  correct .    you  think  that  what  gets  accomplished    important  then  you  are  caught  automatically    the  fruit    action .  you  are  satisfied  that  you  are  doing  the  right  thing  that  you  are  working  towards  the  right  thing .  still  you  know  you  are  doing    now  very  important .  what    are  telling  whatever  you      quite  un important .  what  you  are  accomplished    totally  un important .  what  you      also  un important .  see  for  this    precip itate    will  take  some  time .  see  for  this    precip itate    will  take  some  time .  and  this      new  paradigm .  and  this    the  paradigm    real .  there  there  are  still  lot    band ages  and  lot    you  have  gone  through  ss i  gone  through  amc  gone  through  b fc .  still  you  know  the  suc ra    commitment  was  still  hanging .  see  see  boredom    the  result    goal  orientation  living    goal  orientation .  you  are  expecting  expecting  something    happen    doesn  happen .  then  you  get  bored .  for  example  you  are  waiting  for    bus  and  the  bus  doesn  come .  the  bus  doesn  come .  the  bus  doesn  come .  and  then  you  get  bored  waiting .  boredom    mainly  the  result    goal  orientation  living    goal  orientation .    soon      transcend  the  field    goal  orientation  into  nothing    important    have .  then  everything  turns  into  play .  every  moment      play .  then  boredom      more .

 exactly .  when  you  are    truth  love  will  come .    meditation    also    way    being    truth  then  the  love  will  come .  you  are  dispersed  all  your  things .  the  people  are  semi  normal .  they  will  also  learn .  you  have    very  person  who  learns    their  own  methods .  you  grow .  and  you  know  when    really  grow    love  there      necessity  for      say  many  things .  don  worry .    have  not  come  across  all  these  people      life .  they  just  don  seem    come  around .      not  know  why .  and    they  come  around  you      not  know  why .  you  understand ?    they  come  around  you  there  must      reason .  and    they  don  come  around  with  there  must      reason .  and  you  are  trying    get  into  some  extreme  presence .  they  will    handled    the  law .  there  are  certain  functions .  but  they  will  take  care .  they  have  taken  care    the  forces .    never  hit  anybody      life .  you  know .  phys ically    never  hit  anybody .  and    long      was  fully  you  know    the  presence      own  ah im sa    never  had        somebody  did  attack  for  some  reason    suddenly  found  there  were  500  people  coming  and  telling  them  why  you  are  attacking  this  format .  you  know .    did  not  have      anything .  yes .    you  think  the  threat    punishment    then    form    reaction ?  yes    form    reaction .  for  that  particular  process  and  the  person      that  consciousness  they  receive  they  learn    only    that .    that    situation  react  real ?      not  needed .  you  don  have    react .  the  reaction  will  happen .  and  from  the  reaction .  you  don  have    react .  but  you  will  react  anyway .  you  will  have    level    consciousness  different  people  react .  for  different  things  you  know .    noticed  that    long      practiced  not  even  practiced    long      never  fought  for    right  then  what  happened ?  somebody  would  protect  you  know .  the  forces  would  just  come  around    protect .    didn  have      anything .  but      became    little  bit    climb    right    any  kind      started  establishing  you  know  wanting    have  what  shall    say ?  when  you    for  pleasures  you  will  come  across  lot    difficulties .  when  you  are  seeking  pleasures  you  will  come  across  lot    problems .  when  you  don  seek  pleasures  all  the  pleasures  will  come    you .    you  don  run  after  money  money  will  come    you  huh .  everything .    you  just  don  run  after  they  will  all  start  coming .  then  you  can  say  what  gandhi  wasn  killed    something  huh .  such    person  was  such    great  huh .  ah im sa  why  was    killed    somebody ?  but    could  have  been  killed  long  time  back  huh .    could  have  been  killed  very  time .  and    was  killed  once  because  some  people  got  very  reactive .  and    also  refused    take  revenge .  correct .    said  that    god  would  kill  then    can    killed .  but  there      power    that .  exactly .  that    true .  that    true .  why ?  some  power .  that    when    runs  out  you  know  when  then  then  the  time    you  have  protected    long    you  are  supposed      protected .  and  when      revealed    the  thought  the  accepting  cannot    revealed  not    anything .  why  not ?    mean  gandhi  would  not  blame  him  but  all  other  people  would .  exactly .  why  not ?  all  right .  every  certain  motion .  you  will  have  the  reaction .    transcend  the  k arm ic  cycle  the  only  way    get  out    the  k arm ic  cycle      doing  nothing  not    doing  something .      say  everything    bound    karma  then  there  would  have  been    escape  possible  from  karma .  escape    possible    doing  nothing .  that  true .  you

s adh g uru  and  r ishi  pr ab hak ar    curious  connection !  april  13  2015  when    have    guru  who  strikes    chord  with  people  there  will    always    guru hat ers  too  who  keep  spreading  lies    damage  and  discredit  the  guru .        not  surprising  that  sad h g uru  is ha  foundation  has  his  fair  share    critics  who  call  him    fraud  and  his  spiritual  movement    âģ ľ cult âģ ŀ .    addressed  some    these  âģ ľ cult  concerns âģ ŀ      earlier  article .  most    this called  âģ ľ crit icism âģ ŀ    not  worth  considering  because      devoid    facts  and    full    hate filled  propaganda .  but    must  keep  listening    the  critics  because  they  may  sometimes  dig  out    fact  that  deserves  some  attention .  this  article  focuses    one  such  fact .      the  allegation        allegation    heard  long  back  about  sad h g uru    that    got  trained  under  one  r ishi  pr ab hak ar    sidd ha  sam ad hi  yoga ss y

paid  much  attention    but  recently    happened    talk    one  acquaintance  who  after  learning  that        is ha  med it ator  casually  remarked  that  âģ ľ  med itated  with  sad h g uru  long  back    hyder abad  when    was  part    sidd ha  sam ad hi  yoga âģ ŀ .  this  made    very  curious  and    considered  this  allegation  with  some  seriousness  for  the  first  time .      some  facts          researched    the  internet .  the  most  difficult  part  for    was    separate  facts  from  opinions  and  propaganda .    the  end    could  gather  these  facts  regarding  this  allegation      r ishi  pr ab hak ar who  expired    2014  never  himself  said  anything  about  sad h g uru .  however  r ishi  pr ab hak ar âģ ļ  disciple  rav iji   who      guru  himself  did      record  about  this  and  wrote  the  following      blog  comment    2007      âģ ľ the  arguments  and  counter  arguments  about  j agg i  and  his  life  are  interesting .  one  fact

classes  together  and    started  the  hyder abad  center    r ishi  sam sk r uti  vid ya  kend ra  under  guru ji .  then    was  sent    guru ji  r ishi  pr ab hak ar    co im bat ore    start  center  there .  there    slowly  left  the  organization  and  started  his  own .    renamed  himself    sad g uru  j agg i  vas ud ev  and  became  popular .      his  guru  r ishi  pr ab hak ar  will  not  claim  him      his  student    j agg i  has  not  lived      his  word .  there      secrecy    these  matters .  j agg i  himself  will  accept    still  believe      truthful    have  not  contacted  him    far  after    left  guru ji  r ishi  pr ab hak ar      apart  from  rav iji âģ ļ  statement  there      other  factual  proof    could  find  online  apart  from  some  people  who  claimed  that  they  did  indeed  see  j agg i  vas ud ev  when    was  with  ss y .  and  there  were  couple    is ha  med it ators  who  heard  this  from  people  they  trust  and    were  surprised  like    and  wanted    know  the  truth .        sad h g uru  never  mentioned  r ishi  pr ab hak ar .  but  let    look    some  relevant  facts    know  about  sad h g uru  and  try    put  those    the  context    this  allegation      per  his  own  words  sad h g uru  got  enlightened    september  1981    cham und i  hills  m ys ore .    after  enlightenment  there  was    âģ ľ

organizations  with  similar  objectives âģ ŀ .  reason ?  they  had  âģ ľ method s  and  techniques  but   spirit ual  experience  while  sad h g uru  had    huge  experience  but  did  not  have  any  methods    techniques âģ ŀ .  working  with  them  taught  sad h g uru  âģ ľ what    should  not  âģ ŀ .    picked    some  things  from  these  organizations  and  made  them  into  something  âģ ľ t otally  different âģ ŀ .  these  efforts  culminated  into  the  present  is ha  foundation âģ ļ  programs  âģ ľ where  the  content  may    the  same  but  the  dimension  and  depth  with  which      presented    not  being  done  anywhere  else âģ ŀ .     details  taken  from  his  biography    a ru nd hat i  sub ram an iam  titled  âģ ľ s adh g uru  more  than    life âģ ŀ  pages  87 89  till  1987  sad h g uru  continued  his  yoga  classes which  were  flourishing  with  some  classes  held  even    hyder abad    also  got  married  during  this  time  and  did  other  business  activities    earn  money .      1987  sad h g uru  visited  co im bat ore    meet    friend  and  entered    deep  med itative  state  waiting    the  bus  depot .    was  then    decided  co im bat ore    his  future  home .    1989    conducted  his  first  class  there .  is ha  foundation  was  established  later    co im bat ore    1992 .      analysis      the  most  striking  aspect    rav iji âģ ļ  statement    the  details  provided .  specific  years  and  place  names  were  mentioned .  between  1984 86  sad h g uru  was  still  possibly  interacting  with  outside  organizations  and    his  involvement  with  ss y  cannot    ruled  out .  the  place  âģ ľ g om at ag iri âģ ŀ  mentioned    rav iji  even  figures    a ru nd hat i  sub ram an iam âģ ļ  book  where      mentioned  that  âģ ľ j agg i  conducted    program    g om at ag iri âģ ŀ page  92    per  the  book  sad h g uru  visited  co im bat ore    1987  which  align s  with  rav iji âģ ļ  dates .      one  can  also  see  some  similarities  between  is ha âģ ļ  programs  and  ss y âģ ļ .  ss y âģ ļ  intro  program    called  âģ ľ s idd ha  sam ad hi  yoga âģ ŀ  which  teaches    basic  breathing  technique  and  emphas ises  eating  âģ ľ positive  pr anic âģ ŀ  food .  is ha âģ ļ  flagship  program  called  âģ ľ in ner  engineering âģ ŀ    similar .  interestingly  before  âģ ľ in ner  engineering âģ ŀ  sad h g uru  used    teach    13  day  program  called  âģ ľ sah aja  st ith i  yoga âģ ŀ  which  also  acron y ms    ss y .  r ishi  pr ab hak ar âģ ļ  other  program  called  âģ ľ b h ava  sam ad hi  training âģ ŀ b st  deals  with  handling  emotions  and    intended    âģ ľ v om it  out  what  was  suppressed  for  many  years âģ ŀ .  this  has  some  resemb l ances    is ha âģ ļ  âģ ľ b h ava  sp and ana  program âģ ŀ b sp  r ishi  pr ab hak ar  has    silence  program  called  âģ ľ advanced  meditation  course âģ ŀ am c  designed    âģ ľ take  one  into  one âģ ļ  own  state    silence  within âģ ŀ .  is ha  has    similar  advanced  silence  meditation  program  too  called  âģ ľ s amy ama âģ ŀ .  critics  pointed  out  these  similarities    claim  that  is ha âģ ļ  programs  are    rip off  from  ss y .  that      h asty  conclusion  because  many  organizations  have  similar  programs  art    living  also  has    silence  meditation  program  moreover  sad h g uru  himself  admitted  that    took  some  ideas  from  these  organizations  but  transformed  them  entirely .        but  there  are  some  troubling  aspects    rav iji âģ ļ  statement .    claims  that  sad h g uru  took  teachers  training  with  ss y  which  indicates    far  deeper  involvement  than  what  sad h g uru  hinted      a ru nd hat i  sub ram an iam âģ ļ  book .    rav iji  also  says  that  sad h g uru  was  sent    co im bat ore    r ishi  pr ab hak ar    establish  ss y  there .  this  contradicts  sad h g uru âģ ļ  own  version .  per  sad h g uru    had    mystic  connection  with  co im bat ore  and  v ell iang iri  mountains    his  past  life  and  therefore  selected  co im bat ore    establish  d hy ana  ling a  his  mission    this  life .      however  possible  that    first  came    co im bat ore    some  ss y  related  work  and  then  recognized  his  past life  relation  with  a ru nd hat i  sub ram an iam âģ ļ  book  does  mention  that  sad h g uru  remembered  his  âģ ľ co im bat ore  connection âģ ŀ  unexpectedly  when    visited  co im bat ore    1987 page  100      final  impressions    given  these  facts  this    the  story    construct .  after  enlightenment  sad h g uru  taught  yoga    his  own  for    while .  then    decided    join  with  other  organizations .    this  phase      reasonably  certain  that  sad h g uru  was  involved  with  ss y  possibly      teacher .    need  more  factual  details    establish  the  story  entirely  here .  but      possible  that  sad h g uru  went    co im bat ore    ss y  related  work  and  recognized  his  connection  with  that  place .  this    when  sad h g uru  started  cutting  off  from  ss y        his  own  again  with  his  sah aja  st ith i  yoga .      this    the  possible  story  and  there    nothing  fraudulent  here    some  critics  allege .    conclude  that  blaming  sad h g uru  for  his r ishi  pr ab hak ar  connection    entirely  baseless .      email

the  story  from  their  personal  experience .      frustration    could  not  find  any  such  account    the  internet .  now    last    found  another version    the  story .  your  account  seems  truthful  and    admire  your  courage !    your  revelations    true  are  shocking    say  the  least .  many  sad h g uru  devote es  would    devastated .  but  even  though  you  know  all  you  wrote  here    the  truth  because    was  your  living  experience  others  like    would        dilemma  whether    trust  you    not .  naturally  is ha  devote es  will  trust  sad h g uru  version  than    anonymous  blogger  version .  is ha  critics  will  trust  your  version .  but  for  the  truth  still  remains  un proven  since  there      enough  evidence    definitely  say  one  way    the  other .  what  you  said  could    the  truth  but  what  sad h g uru  claimed  could    the  truth  too .  unless  more  people  connected    ss y  come  out  and  share  the  facts  about  sad h g uru  and  vij ji  the  common  population  would  continue    believe    sad h g uru  version    this    the  sensible  thing    but  alas  even  rav iji    ss y    not  willing    comment    sad h g uru  when    contacted  him !      not  sure  what  the  reasons  are .      have    few  questions    your  account    1 .      interesting  that  you  mentioned  sad h g uru  also  had    bar    addition    poultry  business .    where  else    was  mentioned  including    sad h g uru  biography    a ru nd hat i  sub ram anian .  sad h g uru  himself  mentioned  about  p oultry  business  though .    did  sad h g uru  run    bar  where  people  come  and  drink ?  was      partner    the  whole  owner ?  2 .      also  interesting    know  that  sad h g uru  used  his  enlightenment  story  even    ss y  days .  are  there  any  witnesses    your  claim  that s adh g uru  himself  admitted  that  story    fake  3 .  that  vij ji  suspected  sad h g uru    have    affair  with  bhar ati    mentioned   more  than    life  book .  the  conflicts    their  marital  life  are  also  described    detail .  however  sad h g uru  explained  that     mis under standing    vij ji .  sad h g uru  also  repeatedly  said  that  they  were  many  witnesses  when  vij ji  left  her  body  and  they  can  testify  that  she  left  her  body    her  own  suddenly .  what    you  have    say  about  these  things ?  october  23  2016    9 50 âģ    anonymous  said    this  not    waste    time  lets  agree  that  sad h g uru      fraud .        lied  about  his

researching  sad h g uru  past .    you  rightly  said  sad h g uru    doing  great  service    humanity .    doubt  about  that .  people  including  have  experienced  his pres ence  and  had  wonderful  experiences    bliss .  what  more      need ?  why    blame  him ?  why  can    ignore  his  past  whatever    and    with  his present      clarify      not  blaming  him    all !  you  see    guru  needs      entirely  trust worthy .  100  99 . 9  will  not  absolute  honesty  and  integrity      must  for    spiritual  guru .  take  the  case    n ity an anda .  even    did  many  social  projects  even    had    great  presence  and  or atory  and  even    had    great  following .  many  people  left  their  careers    dedicate  themselves    his  service .  and  one  fine  day    was  revealed  that    had    physical  relationship  with    female  devote e .  now  what  does  this  change ?  nothing .  still  his  med itations  are    powerful  and  still  his  social  work      great .  but  why    you  think  many  people  were  devastated ?  because    promoted    false version    himself    his  followers  and  that  breaks  the  trust .  and  trust    everything    spiritual  matters .    now      pretty  sure  there  are  many  n ity an anda  followers  who  are  still  with  him .  their  trust    not  broken  yet .  revelations    not  shatter  all  people  equally .    depends    how  much  you  believe    your  guru  and  how  much  your t olerance     facts  for  example      100  sure  that  sad h g uru  was    teacher  with  sidd ha

trivial  details  about  his  life  many  times .  isn    curious  that    leaves  out  this  important  detail ?  but    give  benefit    doubt    sad h g uru  and    hope  someday    would  clear  the  air    this .  till  then    comfort  myself    wrote  this  blog  post .    but      understand  that  many  is ha  devote es    not  care  about  this  fact .  you  did  not .  one      friends  did  not .      completely  fine  with  that .      not  judge  you      friend .    just  request  you    not  judge    too  and  try    understand !  thank  you !  december  3  2016    6 57 âģ    r

aining  enlightenment  because  there      karma  left .  both  san ch ita  karma  and  pr ar ab h da  karma  are  completely  dissolved  and  they  have    consciously  create  karma    keep  the  body  alive .  sad h g uru  has  said  this    his  talks  and  gave  given  the  ram ak rish na  desire  for  food      example .  osh o  has  also  said  the  same  thing  and  gave  the  same  example    the  book  called sec rets    yoga    but  the  guy  who    from  ved antic  background  argued  that  enlightenment  doesn  empty  the  pr ar ab d ha  completely  and  the  enlightened  person  has    burn  out  the  pr ar ab hd ha  gradually  throughout  the  rest    his  life .  once  the  pr ar ab d ha  ends  that    when  they  leave  the  body  and  not  right  after  their  enlightenment .  many  sites  online  about  ved anta  also  say  the  same  thing    you  have  any  idea  about  this  which  will  clear    the  contradiction ?    believe    sad h g uru  words

some  specific  reason  why  sad h g uru  didn  acknowledge  him .    guru sh ish ya  tradition    guru  contribution    always  acknowledged .  r ishi  pr ab hak ar  may  not      guru    sad h g uru

what  sad h g uru  said .      not  know  whether  this      contradiction    something  that  can    reconcil ed .  but  people  from  different  schools  always  had  different  perceptions

izing  buddhist  med itations    the  west  though  they    not  deny  the  buddhist  roots  thus  the  statue    called ad i  yog i  not  shiva  because  people  have    fixed  impression    who  shiva  but  this  raises  the  question    ignoring  the  hindu  roots .  should n  hindu ism    credited  for  the  yog ic  tools    provided    the  world ?    think  yes .  even  sad h g uru  does

what    heard  made  sense      and  provided  food  for  thought      benef ical  way .  however    have  been    the  fence  about  actually  taking  any    the  is ha  foundation  courses .      decided    find  out  more  about  him  and  that    what  led      your  article .      have  attended  v ip ass ana  meditation  courses  several  times  and  practice  that  form    meditation .    think    will  stick  with  that  for    daily  practice  one  thing    like  about      that    never  talk      fellow  practitioners      course  they  change  every  time      the  teachers .  there      single  person    the  center  and      avoids  the  personality  orientation  least      experience    far    like  you  said    can  always  listen    the  lectures      want    and  still  get  whatever  benefit    perceive .  and  even        end    taking  one    the  foundation  courses    does  not  mean  that    have    place  sad h g uru      pedest al  and  believe  that  everything      saying    correct true .    can  still  use    own  judgement    can  others      think  maybe  the  root  cause    that  people  expect    all      black  and  white      sure  gur us  make  mistakes  too    their  journey  they  need  not    right  all  the  time  but  that    the  expectation  followers  come    have  and  then  are  disillusion ed  when  one  action  from  the  guru  does  not  fit    with  their  image    the  guru .  another  point    that  when  you  have    large  organization  not  everyone    going      able    adhere      high  code    conduct  all  the  time .        sure  mistakes  will    made    the  people  who  work    the  is ha  foundation    represent    seems  there  are  two  polar ised  groups  the  first  group  are  the  followers    devote es    whose  eyes  sad h g uru  can      wrong  and  even  questioning  him    sac ri lege  personally    don  see  why  g urus  cannot    held  accountable    questioned    followers  and  why  blind  faith    needed .  the  second  group  are  those  who  have  made    their  minds  and  judge  sad h g uru        trick ster  and    fraud .  they  need  not  listen    any  lectures
